# 🖼️ Image Generation Using Stable Diffusion

## 👤 About Myself
Hello! I am Hanish P, a passionate developer with a focus on Web dev and AI related Technologies.This project is my mini-project in my college.

## 📂 About the Project
This project demonstrates how to generate images from text prompts using the Stable Diffusion model. It utilizes the **Diffusers** and **Transformers** libraries to create images based on descriptive text. The project showcases the potential of AI in creative fields, enabling users to visualize concepts simply by describing them in words. 

## ⚠️ Important Note
**This project is designed to run in Google Colab.** 🖥️ Due to the computational requirements of the Stable Diffusion model, it needs a GPU to function effectively, which may not be available on standard personal computers. Google Colab provides the necessary GPU support to run this project seamlessly.

Feel free to explore the code and try generating your own images!
